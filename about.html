<h2> Program Goal </h2>
<p> The goal of the program is to offer an accelerated 
    and demanding curriculum for our most gifted and talented students 
    who are considering attending highly competitive colleges and universities. 
    The Program will also give the students exposure to many different fields, 
    using a variety of educational expediencies, to find their perfect niche.
    This will eventually lead to the students not walking into their higher education wondering what to study.

<h2> Our Motto </h2>
<p> 
    <i> "... Leadership tomorrow depends on how we educate our 
    students todayâ€”especially in science, technology, engineering and math." </i>
